i hear vomiting helps 'get it out'
sure thing, but when the govt gives you subsidies, do you turn them down? blame the ppl pushing for subsidies. blame the ppl who aren't opposing subsidies hard enough. but when you're caught in the middle, free money's fair game.

They want people to physically attack them. Then they file assault charges and sue. That's how their support their *church*.
Puppies. Kittens don't bark. 
The Palestinians have a right to defend themselves.  In this instance we see them also insisting on a right to eat, to move around freely, to have medicine, to earn a living, things like that.

dude, aquaman is awesome.  I mean, he could control the Bloop and tell us what it actually is, right?
Do you actually know anything about statistics, or are you just saying things that sound good?  What sample size would be large enough?  Why?  How would it have to be drawn?
And when, if ever, do these clowns plan on upgrading to DC-10s which even now are out of date?
Nah. H.264 videos are usually high-quality (if not outright high-definition—consider Apple's movie trailers, for example), and even MPEG-4 video is pretty good. newlinechar  newlinechar And, honestly, Windows Media video *can* be good, too, although it usually isn't.

This has nothing to do with speeding.  The article mentions arrestable offenses where you're searched after being arrested.  Speeding doesn't count.
Guess not.  I always get the 'get a better job like I did' comments, or some people think I want sympathy.  I just want the government to stop fucking around with my life...
I passed one and lied on every question.  No technique.
I absolutely refuse to believe we're living in a dystopian big-brother future until I get my victory gin!
Yes, it's very important. What they didn't mention is that you should also preheat the oven before going to the grocery store to get the ingredients.
Well, for it to be better for [scientology](http://xenu.net/) the thetans shouldn't be from [scientology](http://xenu.net/). That way the church of [scientology](http://xenu.net/) could start charging for auditing them so they, too, could pay for the benefits of [scientology](http://xenu.net/). newlinechar  newlinechar edited for clarity.
. . . who take Psych classes.
&gt; Partial application and monads pretty much replace macros for me in Haskell. newlinechar  newlinechar They only replace trivial macros. What about stuff like embedded DSLs, compile-time parsing of data files, etc?
and.. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pretty sure you left out the part where you give your opinion on the taste of it, since that's what the conversation is about. Let's try again.
Yeah, and throw a cup in there for good measure.
No it vanished vanished..  not even in archives/search, and only after 20 hours. If I could not have karma for this post I'd be happy for it, but it's a great doc and links shouldn't just go *poof*
At first I thought it was just Chuck endorsing the Huckster, but he went all out at it. Seems a bit much, even for my tastes.
Ap-pear-ently not.
No worse than all of those sites that still use that Netscape favicon.
Fair enough.
Actually, I was just high and thought it would be funny to see how far I could get downmodded.

&gt;Most people here don't like Ron Paul. The reason we sometimes upvote Ron Paul articles is because he's the least evil Republican candidate. newlinechar  newlinechar My jaw just dropped.  How long have you been here?
No, I'm ... wait, I mean yes I ... no, hang on. Why's this blood coming out of my ears?
I'm 22.. My main aspiration is to be a good dad and a good person.  Everything else, to me, is secondary. 
I smell a divorce in Tipper's future, lads. 
Except he'd remove a ton of regulations as well, so the problem would still be rampant. 
MOOO!!!!!!
The problem is the percentage of people we're 'keeping off the streets' that the streets would've been just fine with had we not.
&gt;We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off. 
Maybe we should quit being so fucking judgmental and pious.

Elmer Fudd would approve.
Except, they do wear masks.  You have to wear masks when your day job is killing people you have to live next to.  
That is not a religion...
does said knowledge have to be real? or can I just make it up?
That is exactly how I feel.  You are not alone.
I rained on his parade a few days ago. :)
Everybody's fault.  Next question.
Shouldn't you read about [scientology](http://xenu.net/) before you come to that conclusion?
keep it up and google will identify this as an SEO site and it'll be all for naught.
No, no, no. It stands for 'Telecommunications Device for the Deaf'. Duh!
Weeell, in his defense, the original argument **did** talk about a conventional clock...
You got downvoted (not by me) because Paul wasn't your #1. Welcome to Reddit, where your opinion matters as long as we agree.
Not at all.  It's 'quit the knee-jerk reactions when Ron Paul doesn't win something'.
Yes it would...
[Scientology.](http://xenu.net/?)
Well, it certainly sounds like it has a lot of [Scientology information](http://xenu.net/). Now I can learn more about the [Church of Scientology](http://xenu.net/).
damn :( got excited for a second there when i read the headline
For a group so badly oppressed during the WWII era, they sure do a lot of oppression.
This would be META-SAC: 'mass hysteria with purpose to increase awareness of mass hysteria with purpose'?

No, I'm not overlooking anything, I'm saying you're a delusional liar whose testimony on this matter has as much value as LRH's opinions about calculus. newlinechar  newlinechar

You're right, hardware companies never release their hardware with buggy firmware on it.
Upmod, for trying to spread some sanity.   newlinechar  newlinechar I can understand why Ron Paul fans are antagonistic towards Giuliani (well, because, he's earned it).  Acting on that feeling is juvenile, much like Rudy's laughter during the debates.
I think I love you.
You're doing it wrong.
I prefer fountain pens if you're ok with that.

My favourite part about that quote is that a hogshead is 63 US gallons (presumably based on a standard sized large barrel), and a rod is a few feet (based on a standardised measuring rod).  That's pretty lousy fuel efficiency.
clinton stretching the truth? no way.

I want it to be entertaining.  Ron Paul, on grainy film, talking about issues with a big constitution behind him... that won't fly in this situation.
It's sad that the people that use their brains in this country are the social outcasts and hermits that post on reddit.
