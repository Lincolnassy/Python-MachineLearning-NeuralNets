# Python-MachineLearning-NeuralNets
machines somewhat smart?

For all the projects, make sure you have python installed and run pip install for all imports needed.

For all the projects in machine learning, you can run each one by calling the respective cmd command or iOS command(not much a Mac user).

For the neural network project folder, you'll have to install tensorflow (tensorflow gpu is faster but hard to setup).
You can run all the projects except the chatbot one. Chatbot project was too big to upload.
